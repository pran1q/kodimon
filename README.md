## description 
The Kodimon application is engaging, yet simple application where we can fetch Pokemon, each having it's own corresponding name, stats 
and image. Pokemon with higher speed will attack first. After we have pressed "attack" button logs will show how much damage did they 
deal. Fight is over when one of the Pokemon drops below 0 health points after we can choose to press "New game" or "Home" button.

## starting and using the application
We need to navigate to root folder and run "npm install" in terminal. After we install all
dependencies we can run "npm start". By default, application will run on http://localhost:3000/.
